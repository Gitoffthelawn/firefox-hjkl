# hjkl

I was looking for a **simple** firefox extension to add *minimal* vim-like navigation to webpages.

I already knew a lot of firefox shortcuts, so I didn't want to have to re-learn them all, I just wanted to add hjkl 
navigation so I don't have to use the arrow keys or my mouse to scroll a page.

## Installation 

You can find the addon page here: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/vim-hjkl/
